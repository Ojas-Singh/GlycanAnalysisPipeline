# GlycanAnalysisPipeline 🧬

Glycan conformations analysis pipeline for [GlycoShape Database](https://glycoshape.org).

<img src="docs/Figure.jpg" alt="Schematic overview of Glycan Analysis Pipeline (GAP) used to build the GlycoShape Glycan Database (GDB). Panel a) Multiple uncorrelated replica molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed for each glycan in the GDB, to comprehensively sample its structural dynamics. The resulting MD frames are then transformed into a graph matrix representation, as depicted in Panel b), simplified by flattening the lower half as shown in Panel c). This step enables a dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis (PCA), shown in Panel d). These data are clustered by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the results of which are displayed in terms of cluster distributions, see Panel e). Panel f) Representative 3D structures for each cluster are selected based on KDE maxima, along with comprehensive torsion angle profiles for the highest populated clusters, showing the wide breadth of the conformational space covered by GAP. Panel g) Structures derived from GAP are clearly presented on the GlycoShape GDB web platform, in addition to biological and chemical information." style="zoom: 33%;" />

## Installation 💻

The pipeline uses Python 3.10 and uv (a fast Python package manager) for dependency management.

### Linux/macOS 🐧🍏

1. Make the installation script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

### Manual Installation (Alternative) 🛠️

If you prefer manual installation:

1. Install Python 3.10 (if not already installed)
2. Install uv: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
3. Create virtual environment: `uv venv --python 3.10 .venv`
4. Activate environment:
   - Linux/macOS: `source .venv/bin/activate`
   - Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
5. Install dependencies: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Configure ⚙️

Before running the pipeline, ensure the following environment variables are set up.

```bash
export GLYCOSHAPE_DATA_DIR=/path/to/glycoshape/data
export GLYCOSHAPE_PROCESS_DIR=/path/to/glycoshape/process_dir
export GLYCOSHAPE_OUTPUT_PATH=/path/to/glycoshape/final_database
export GLYCOSHAPE_INVENTORY_PATH=/path/to/glycoshape/inventory
export GLYCOSHAPE_DB_UPDATE=True
export GLYTOUCAN_CONTRIBUTOR_ID=your_contributor_id
export GLYTOUCAN_API_KEY=your_api_key
export GLYCOSHAPE_RDF_DIR=/path/to/glycoshape/rdf
```

Ensure the required directories and files exist, or modify the paths as needed.

## Running 🚀

```bash
python main.py
```
or

Run using install.sh as it will save log in last_run.log
```bash
./install.sh --run
```

## SPARQL Endpoint 🕸️

```bash

# Set or override the RDF folder (defaults to GLYCOSHAPE_OUTPUT_PATH/GLYCOSHAPE_RDF)
export GLYCOSHAPE_RDF_DIR="${GLYCOSHAPE_RDF_DIR:-${GLYCOSHAPE_OUTPUT_PATH}/GLYCOSHAPE_RDF}"

# Load and serve the RDF dataset
oxigraph load --location "$GLYCOSHAPE_RDF_DIR" --file "$GLYCOSHAPE_RDF_DIR/GLYCOSHAPE_RDF.ttl"
oxigraph serve --location "$GLYCOSHAPE_RDF_DIR"
```

If your GLYCOSHAPE_RDF folder is in a different path, set GLYCOSHAPE_RDF_DIR to that path before running the commands.

This will host the SPARQL endpoint at http://localhost:7878

## Deactivation 📴

To deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```
